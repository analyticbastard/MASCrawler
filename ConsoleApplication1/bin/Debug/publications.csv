572996,Locally lifting the curse of dimensionality for nearest neighbor search (extended abstract),2000,We consider the problem of nearest neighbor search in the Euclidean hypercube [-1,+1] d with uniform distributions, and the additional natural assumption that the nearest neighbor is located within a constant fraction R of the maximum interpoint distance in this space, i.e. within distance 2Rv~ of the query. We introduce the idea of aggressive pruning and give a family of

A maximum matching for G consists of minfn; n 0 g edges from distinct red nodes to distinct blue nodes. Our objective is to find a minimum-cost maximum matching, i.e., one for which the sum of the

This paper presents a bipartite weighted graph matching approach to these problems, based on the authors' linear time matching algorithms‡.

229647,Towards EM-style Algorithms for Posterior Optimization of Normal Mixtures,1997, Expectation maximization (EM) providesa simple and elegant approach to the problemof optimizing the parameters of a normal mixture onan unlabeled dataset. To accomplish this, EM iterativelyreweights the elements of the dataset until alocally optimal normal mixture is obtained. This paperexplores the intriguing question of whether suchan EM-style algorithm exists for the related and apparentlymore difficult problem of finding a normalmixture

The ambient logic is a modal logic designed to spec- ify properties of distributed and mobile computations prog rammed in the ambient calculus. In this paper we investigate the border between decidable and undecid- able cases of model checking mobile ambients for some fragments of
761576,Model checking mobile ambients,2003,We settle the complexity bounds of the model checking problem for the ambient calculus with public names against the ambient logic. We show that if either the calculus contains replication or the logic contains the composition adjunct, the problem is undecidable. In the case of the replication-free calculus and the logic without composition adjunct we prove that the problem is

We show that the problem is PSPACE-complete. For the complexity upper-bound, we devise a new representation of processes that remains of polynomial size during process execution; this allows us to keep the model checking procedure
23383,Entailment of Atomic Set Constraints is PSPACE-Complete,1999, The complexity of set constraints has been extensivelystudied over the last years and was often found quitehigh. At the lower end of expressiveness, there areatomic set constraints which are conjunctions of inclusions t 1 t 2 between first-order terms without set operators.It is well-known that satisfiability of atomic setconstraints can be tested in cubic time. Also, entailmentof atomic set constraints
1707694,When ambients cannot be opened,2005,Abstract. We investigate expressiveness of a fragment of the ambient calculus, a formalism for describing distributed and mobile computations. More precisely, we study expressiveness of the pure and public ambient calculus from which the capability has been removed, in terms of the reachability problem of the reduction relation. Surprisingly, we show that even for this very restricted fragment, the reachability
1809720,Expressiveness of a Spatial Logic for Trees,2005,In this paper we investigate the quantifier-free fragment of the TQL logic proposed by Cardelli and Ghelli. The TQL logic, inspired from the ambient logic, is the core of a query language for semistructured data represented as unranked and unordered trees. The fragment we consider here, named STL, contains as main features spatial com- position and location as well as
1810337,Monotone AC-Tree Automata,2005,We consider several questions about monotone AC-tree automata, a class of equational tree automata whose transition rules correspond to rules in Kuroda normal form of context-sensitive grammars. Whereas it has been proved that this class has a decision procedure to determine if, given a monotone AC-tree automaton, it accepts no terms, other important decidability or complexity results have not been

We define two distinct fragments of this logic: TL containing only spa- tial connectives and TL9 containing spatial connectives and quantification. We show that the combined complexity of TL is PSPACE-hard. We

 Visibly pushdown transducers (VPTs) form a strict subclass of pushdown transducers (PTs) that extends finite state transducers with a stack. Like visibly pushdown automata, the input symbols determine the stack
 operations. It has been shown that visibly pushdown languages form a robust subclass of context-free languages. Along the
 same line, we show that word transductions defined by VPTs enjoy strong
4247238,Satisfiability of a Spatial Logic with Tree Variables,2007,We investigate in this paper the spatial logic TQL for querying semi- structured data, represented as unranked ordered trees over an infinite alphabet. This logic consists of usual Boolean connectives, spatial connectives (derived from the constructors of a tree algebra), tree variables and a fixpoint operator for recursion. Motivated by XML-oriented tasks, we investigate the guarded TQL fragment. We prove

The noise is assumed to be generated as the solution of a linear time-varying differential equation driven by white noise. The Markov property of the noise is used to derive a difference equation for the likelihood ratio. The terms in the difference equation

This derivation of the C-R bound emphasizes its optimum nature. The relationship of
304364,An empirical study of algorithms for point-feature label placement,1995,A major factor affecting the clarity of graphical displays that include text labels is the degree to which labels obscure display features (including other labels) as a result of spatial overlap. Point-feature label placement (PFLP) is the problem of placing text labels adjacent to point features on a map or diagram so as to maximize legibility. This problem occurs frequently
806515,Automating the layout of network diagrams with specified visual organization,1994,Network diagrams are a familiar graphic form that can express many different kinds of information. The problem of automating network-diagram layout has therefore received much attention. Previous research on network-diagram layout has focused on the problem of aesthetically optimal layout, using such criteria as the number of link crossings, the sum of all link lengths, and total diagram area. In

On the other hand, no approach to label placement thatis based on an efficient optimization technique has been applied to the production of generalcartographic maps --- those with labeled point, line, and area features

This problem is seen in its most essentialform in cartography, but it also arises frequently in the production of other informationalgraphics such as scatterplots.

14374379,On the existence of perfect space-time codes,2009,Perfect space-time codes are codes for the coherent multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel. They have been called so since they satisfy a large number of design criteria that makes their performances outmatch many other codes. In this correspondence, we discuss the existence of such codes (or more precisely, the existence of perfect codes with optimal signal complexity).

726989,Divider-based algorithms for hierarchical tree partitioning,2004,We present algorithms for computing hierarchical decompositions of trees satisfying different optimization criteria, including balanced cluster size, bounded number of clusters, and logarithmic depth of the decomposition. Furthermore, every high-level representation of the tree obtained from such decompositions is guaranteed to be a tree. These criteria are relevant in many application settings, but appear to be difficult to achieve simultaneously.
